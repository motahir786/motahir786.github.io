<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>My 1st Blog</h2>
<p>I thought that the section about stone soup and boiled frogs was super interesting. I love the use of curiosity to get a big job done. The mind of the villagers is diverted to the stones, but this in turn makes them go get the ingredients individually which leads to a meal for the whole village. </p>
<p>This was a change in the usual structure of the village. Now with the soldiers coming in and using the trick they used, got the villagers to unknowingly cause a change, the soldiers became a catalyst for the change.</p>
<p>We often find ourselves in situations where we have a great idea, but convincing the people required to fulfill that idea seems like a huge stretch. This is where we need to bring the stones out, we need to show something for it, we have to develop on the idea clearly and to the point, then present it to the people that need to be convinced. This way there is a better chance of them understanding what you had in mind, and in turn themselves start contributing due to curiosity. People love to join an ongoing success, rather than bringing it to success. If someone sees a glimpse of success in the future for what you show them, they will surely stick around. </p>
